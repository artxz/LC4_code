# LC4_code
analysis and modeling code for LC4 and target descending neurons

There are 3 R scripts, run "LC4_startup.R" first. 
Then "LC4_proc.R" (mostly analysis of LC4) and "LC4_target_proc.R" (mainly analysis of descending neurons) can be run independently.

Sections for plotting figures in the paper are named as, eg. "PLOT Fig.3g" or "PLOT ED Fig.5b".
